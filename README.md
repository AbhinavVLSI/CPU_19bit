# CPU_19bit

A 5-stage pipelined RISC processor implemented in Verilog, featuring data forwarding, hazard detection, and a custom instruction set.

ðŸ“– About The Project

This project is a complete implementation of a 5-stage pipelined CPU from scratch in Verilog HDL. The architecture is designed for efficiency, mitigating common pipeline hazards through dedicated hardware units. It's a great project for understanding the core principles of computer architecture, including instruction set design, pipelining, data dependencies, and control logic.
The pipeline is structured into the following five stages:
IF (Instruction Fetch): Fetches the next instruction from memory.
ID (Instruction Decode): Decodes the instruction, reads operands from the register file, and generates control signals.
EX (Execute): Performs calculations in the ALU.
MEM (Memory Access): Reads from or writes to data memory.
WB (Write Back): Writes the result back into the register file.

 FEATURES
 
5-Stage Pipelined Design: Classic RISC pipeline for parallel instruction execution.
Data Hazard Resolution: A forwarding_unit resolves data hazards without stalling the pipeline in most cases.
Control & Load-Use Hazard Detection: A hazard_unit flushes the pipeline on branches/jumps and stalls for load-use hazards to ensure correct execution.
Custom RISC ISA: A custom instruction set architecture (ISA) with support for:
Arithmetic (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, INC, DEC)
Logical (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
Memory (LD, ST)
Control Flow (JMP, BEQ, BNE, CALL, RET)
Specialized Instructions: Includes custom opcodes for FFT, ENC (Encryption), and DCRPT (Decryption) to showcase extensibility.
16 x 32-bit Register File: A general-purpose register file for data manipulation.

Architecture Overview

The CPU is composed of several key modules working together:
cpu_top: The top-level module that connects all the components and pipeline registers.
control_unit: Decodes instruction opcodes to generate the necessary control signals for each pipeline stage.
reg_file: The 16-entry, 32-bit register file.
alu: The Arithmetic Logic Unit that performs all calculations.
imm_gen: Generates and sign-extends immediate values from instructions.
forwarding_unit: Implements forwarding logic to pass results from later pipeline stages back to the Execute stage, preventing unnecessary stalls.
hazard_unit: Detects load-use data hazards (which require a stall) and control hazards from branches and jumps (which require a pipeline flush).
